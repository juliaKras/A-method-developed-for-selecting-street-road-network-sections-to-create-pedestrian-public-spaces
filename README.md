# A-method-developed-for-selecting-street-road-network-sections-to-create-pedestrian-public-spaces
This code describes a method developed for selecting street-road network sections to create pedestrian public spaces. Based on analysis of existing works, criteria for assessing the potential and necessity of traffic restrictions were developed. Python programming language was applied to collect and analyze data on selected criteria.  Approbation of the developed method in the Central District of St. Petersburg allowed to demonstrate how our method works. With limited resources, an intelligent approach to street pedestrianization could solve the problem of public spaces lacking in cities.
