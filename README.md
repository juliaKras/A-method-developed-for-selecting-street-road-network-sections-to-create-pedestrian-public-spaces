# A-method-developed-for-selecting-street-road-network-sections-to-create-pedestrian-public-spaces
This code describes a method developed for selecting street-road network sections to create pedestrian public spaces. Based on analysis of existing works, criteria for assessing the potential and necessity of traffic restrictions were developed. Python programming language was applied to collect and analyze data on selected criteria.  Approbation of the developed method in the Central District of St. Petersburg allowed to demonstrate how our method works. With limited resources, an intelligent approach to street pedestrianization could solve the problem of public spaces lacking in cities.

Having written the code based on the data presented, you can see its work on the example of one district of St. Petersburg.

The figure visualizes the result of the code (the number of points scored for each link). Based on the points scored, the selection of streets for pedestrianization will be made in the future.

The code and data provided is part of an article under development "A method developed for selecting street to create pedestrian public spaces with the use of transport modelling".
