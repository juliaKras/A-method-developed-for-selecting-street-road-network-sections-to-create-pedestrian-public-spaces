# A-method-developed-for-selecting-street-road-network-sections-to-create-pedestrian-public-spaces
This article describes a method developed for selecting street-road network sections to create pedestrian public spaces. Based on analysis of existing works, the authors developed criteria for assessing the potential and necessity of traffic restrictions. Python programming language and QGIS program were applied to collect and analyze data on selected criteria.  The authors also applied simulation in MATSim to solve the problem of checking the possibility of restricting transit traffic on the street. Approbation of the developed method in the Central District of St. Petersburg allowed to demonstrate how our method works, as well as how multi-agent modeling can be used to form pedestrian public spaces on the city streets. With limited resources, an intelligent approach to street pedestrianization could solve the problem of public spaces lacking in cities.
